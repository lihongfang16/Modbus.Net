Modbus.Net Overview
===================

* [Teambition Project](https://www.teambition.com/project/573860b0f668c69e61d38a84/tasks)

Overview
-------------------
Modbus.Net is an open hardware communication platform written in C# 7.0.

You can focus on the protocol itself and the platform can automatically create a full asynchronous or synchronous communication library.

Why is it called Modbus.Net
-------------------
Modbus.Net was open sourced two years ago when I graduated. The first target of this project was to implement remote PLC communication using Modbus TCP. Half a year later the company decide to use a IoT hardware, then a more universal architecture was required. The main platform changed to a universal communication platform. Despite all these changes the name "Modbus.Net" stuck.

The real Modbus Implementation has been moved to [Modbus.Net.Modbus]( https://www.nuget.org/packages/Modbus.Net.Modbus). If you want a real Modbus C# implementation, please download [Modbus.Net]( https://www.nuget.org/packages/Modbus.Net) and [Modbus.Net.Modbus]( https://www.nuget.org/packages/Modbus.Net.Modbus) at the same time.

There is also [Modbus.Net.Siemens]( https://www.nuget.org/packages/Modbus.Net.Siemens) that can communicate with Siemens S7-200, S7-200 Smart, S7-300, S7-400, S7-1200 and S7-1500 using PPI or TCP/IP.

[Modbus.Net.OPC]( https://www.nuget.org/packages/Modbus.Net.OPC) Implements OPC DA and OPC UA protocol.

Supported Platforms
-------------------
* Visual Studio 2017
* .NET Framework 4.5
* .NET Standard 2.0
